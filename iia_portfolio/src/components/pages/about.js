      <p className="paragraph">
      I am a Linguistics undergraduate looking to put my love for language learning into language app development. I graduated from the University of Florida in 2018 and have been learning languages and practicing my specialty coffee skills ever since. I have a minor in Mandarin and I am learning German and Japanese in my free time. I started taking a Full Stack Web Development boot camp in the summer of 2022. My ultimate goal is to combine language learning with web development and create a program to help others who love to learn languages like I do!
